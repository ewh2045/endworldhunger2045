<p>These two don&#8217;t know their father, because their father abandoned his family when they were very young. Mohamed and Abdalah are vulnerable children. Their mother is called Rehema Shaban, she cries and worries a lot because of her children and she does not has a job. Many times they sleep without eating anything.</p>
<div>Abdalah wants to be a doctor and his brother wants to be a engineer.</div>
